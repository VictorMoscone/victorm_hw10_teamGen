Once you have the app running, you'll be given a series of prompts to enter in the manager for your team. Once done, you'll be asked to add either another employee or generate your page.

## Reflection

Our jest tests were provided to us as a way to nudge us in the right direction when it came to creating our classes. It was a lot of fun! However, I quickly completed that part of this app and fell into the rabbit hole of trying to use await/async with inquirer. I wasted a tremendous amount of time trying to figure it out, time that could have been spent improving the end result of the app. If I had that time back, I would write logic that keeps 3 employees per row on the team page and generates a new row for the next 3.
